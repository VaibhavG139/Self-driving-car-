# 🛣️ Self-Driving Car Project

This project simulates a self-driving car using Python and machine learning/computer vision techniques. It demonstrates how autonomous vehicles can detect lanes, avoid obstacles, and navigate a track without human intervention.

## 🚀 Features

- Lane detection and following
- Obstacle avoidance
- AI-controlled decision-making using neural networks
- Real-time simulation
- Visualization of sensor inputs and path

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyGame / Matplotlib (for simulation/visualization)
- TensorFlow / Keras (if applicable)
- Custom sensors or simulated LiDAR (if applicable)
